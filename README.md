## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

Many used clothes end up in landfills, contributing to environmental pollution, carbon emissions, and water wastage. At the same time, many vulnerable groups lack access to sustainable livelihoods. Our solution aims to address both these issues by promoting recycling of used clothes and creating income opportunities for underserved communities.

### How our technology solution can help

An AI-powered app that promotes clothes recycling and empowers local communities.

### Our idea    

Kind Threads is an innovative platform designed to educate people on the environmental benefits of recycling used clothes, while also providing a seamless way for users to take action. By leveraging IBM Watsonx.AI for image recognition, our app enables users to take pictures of any clothing item and receive insights into how that item can be reused, recycled, or donated based on its condition.

The core of our solution is an AI-driven identification system that assesses the item’s wearability and provides data-driven recommendations, such as:

- How much water could be saved by recycling the item
- How much CO2 emissions could be reduced
- Nearby recycling or donation centers where the item can be dropped off

The app promotes environmental sustainability by gamifying the experience for end users. Each item they donate or recycle adds to their personal impact statistics, which display the cumulative environmental benefits they’ve contributed—such as the amount of carbon prevented or water conserved. These tangible metrics help motivate users to participate in the circular economy.

Additionally, our solution tackles social equity by creating micro-economic opportunities for low-wage workers and vulnerable groups. Through the platform, these individuals can sign up as pickup and delivery agents, earning money by collecting and delivering items to recycling centers or donation hubs. This helps bridge the gap between environmental sustainability and economic inclusion, offering these workers a sustainable income stream.

Our platform is built using cutting-edge technologies:

- **IBM Watsonx.AI** powers the image recognition and AI-based recommendations.
- **Next.js** and **React.js** provide a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Python FastAPI** manages backend processes efficiently, ensuring smooth operation and scalability.
- **LangChain** is used to streamline decision-making processes and optimize AI outputs.

By combining these technologies, Kind Threads is not only reducing environmental waste but also empowering underserved communities. Unlike other recycling platforms that focus solely on environmental aspects, Kind Threads integrates social impact, making it an inclusive solution for sustainable living.


## Technology implementation

### IBM watsonx product(s) used

_INSTRUCTIONS: Included here is a list of IBM watsonx products. Remove any products you did not use. Leave only those included in your solution code. In your official submission on the Call for Code Global Challenge web site, you are required to provide details on where and how you used each IBM watsonx product so judges can review your implementation. Remove these instructions._

**Featured watsonx products**

- [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [watsonx.governance](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

- [watsonx Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watsonx-assistant) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION

### Other IBM technology used

INSTRUCTIONS: List any other IBM technology or IBM AI services used in your solution and describe how each component was used. If you can provide details on where these were used in your code, that would help the judges review your submission.

### Solution architecture

REPLACE THIS EXAMPLE WITH YOUR OWN, OR REMOVE THIS EXAMPLE

Diagram and step-by-step description of the flow of our solution:

![Video transcription/translaftion app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Presentation materials

_INSTRUCTIONS: The following deliverables should be officially posted to your My Team > Submissions section of the [Call for Code Global Challenge resources site](https://cfc-prod.skillsnetwork.site/), but you can also include them here for completeness. Replace the examples seen here with your own deliverable links._
